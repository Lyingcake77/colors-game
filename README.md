# About

Colors is a game that I originally wrote back in 1991 while in college.     The original game was written in Turbo Pascal and Assembler.

I started this project to learn how game development was done in Javascript with Phaser.

This turned out to be a fun project, and I hope people have fun with the game and maybe learn a thing or two about Phaser.

## Warning ##

This game is an early work-in-progress!  

I will try to make sure that the code checked into github is working and functional, but I make no promises right now!

# Running the Game

Deploy everything in the src directory to a web server.   Have fun.

# Playing the game

*Colors* is a Tetris-like game where colored pieces fall into a pit.  Blocks are made of different colors.  While the blocks cannot be rotate, the colors inside of the block can be shifted.   

Blocks are removed from the board when a match of three or greater blocks of the same color is formed.   Block chains can be formed horizontally, vertically, and diagonally.

Once the pit fills up, the game is over.

# Controls

All control is currently by keyboard.

The following keys are used to move a piece:

+ **Left Arrow** - move piece to the Left
+ **Right Arrow** - move the piece to the Right
+ **Down Arrow** - move the piece Down
+ **Up Arrow** - rotate the piece colors upwards
+ **Space** - drop the piece to the bottom

The additional controls are available:

+ **Escape** - pause
